
# Two-dimensional self-attention-based speech enhancement

# Requirements
Tensorflow = 1.4.0

# Datasets
The speech stored in this git is enhanced by our 2D-SA. 
We evaluate the performance on two datasets. <br>
(1) An open-source dataset [1]. <br>
(2) A large-scale dataset (Designed and generated by ourselves). <br>

In this Git, enhanced speech, models, and the enhanced edges are uploaded. <br> 
The details and scripts of training and testing are included in folder Scripts <br>
In the folder appendix, more explanations about model structure and hyper-parameters will be added.
